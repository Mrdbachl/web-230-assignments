WEB-230 | How PHP Works – Server Side Scripting – Assignment
Explain the following:

Identify and explain the differences between server side and client side.
Server side script is produced on a web server, which then responds to a website where a client has made a request.
Client side script is where scripts are embedded and run client side in the web browser (IE Javascript)

Identify and explain the differences between scripting and programming languages.
Scripts are either embedded into programming languages or they are used on the server side to create customized interfaces for users. 
Programming languages are used on the client side and are viewable by the user within the web browser.


Explain what type of language PHP is.
PHP is a server side language that is also used as a general purpose programming language. 
It can be embedded into HTML or HTML5, but on the web side, it usually needs an interpreter.


Explain the process of a request from client to server and back to client.
The client types in a page request that goes to the server, the server then processes the request and sends back the page to the client.


Explain the differences between the different post types discussed in the video.
The two different types that are explained are HTTP Get and HTTP Post. HTTP Get has character length limitations because it can only be as long as the url length. 
The Get is also cached. The Post is not cached and there are no length limitations, so more information can be sent by the server.
